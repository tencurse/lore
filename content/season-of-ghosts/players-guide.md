## Character Creation

- Name
- Age
- Gender/Pronouns
- Physical description
- Backstory
- Occupation
- Societal standing
- Key relationships
	- You may be family/friends/enemies with any existing NPCs or custom
- Where are you from?
	- If your character isn’t born in [[Willowshore]], how and why did they come to live in Willowshore?
	- Related: Pick a house where you live in from the map! I’ll edit this doc to indicate who lives where :)
- Primary motivation
	- Reasons to be rooted in Willowshore (family, friends, job, etc.)
	- Why is your character chosen to participate in this year’s Reenactment Festival? (See [[season-of-ghosts/players-guide#Backgrounds]])
- Primary fears
- Story hooks
- Items
	- Choose one of the items below. Only one in the party can take each, so call dibs! I’ll edit this doc to label who took which item. :)

## Character Sheet

Since this is everyone’s first PF2e game, I will allow you to respec (for a price!) if you don’t like the class/build you’re playing. This is different from [retraining](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2447) which allows you to change your feats, skills, or class features during downtime.

Recommend you to take the following skills:
- Religion
- Occultism
- Willowshore Lore

At least one in the party should be trained in these skills, although there are alternate skills that can be used, so you don’t *have* to take it if you don’t want to.

We’re starting Level 1. Don’t worry about it.

### Backgrounds

Here are custom backgrounds from the AP books that can help you decide why your character was chosen to participate in this year’s Reenactment Festival! You may choose other backgrounds {insert whatever from the Player’s Guide}.
