# Fugue
## Physical Description

- Pretty boy eunuch – as in he has no dick and balls type of eunuch
- Long black silky hair, half of it pulled up in a top knot? Or laid down.
- Pallid greyish skin
- Looks frail and sickly
- Soft, delicate face, long eyelashes, serene smile, muted red irises
- Stands tall at around 6’7”, lean muscular (sleeper?) build covered up with his white priestly robes
- His robe is a white pleated hanfu with bloodred fabric on the underside.
	- Something like [this](https://thehanfustory.com/collections/men-hanfu/products/men-hanfu-tie-li-robe-chivalrous-swordsman-in-ming-dynasty-%E4%BE%A0%E5%AE%A2?variant=43250591531166) but with white fabric and red embroidery and hemming?
- He wears a white fox mask with red paint around the eyes. It covers the upper half of his face.
	- Grief is faceless and his job is to help people through that, and it’s better if they don’t see him as a person but instead a tool of his god. (Even if he’s very secretive about who that god is.)

I like a white and red colour palette for him. Just to subvert the “trope” of Sharrans wearing all black (because it’s supposed to represent oblivion). But in his case, he wears white, which represents a blank slate. It’s what he markets himself as: someone who provides a “fresh start” with Sharran ceremonies to erase memories and such. In a way, he is also that: a blank slate.

### Mask

The mask serves two purposes:

1. To hide that he’s Reborn, because he has stitches on his forehead due to a brain surgery done by Kiko when he died. He finds the scars shameful, a constant reminder that he is not a person. It’s also easier to be around his colleagues with the mask on. (They don’t have to see the face of their dead friend walking around alive.)
2. To hide that he is still “alive”. Fugue is not aware of this motive, which is purely Shar’s. Shar wants to hide him from the Selunite paladin who had killed him.

Narratively, the fox mask symbolizes deception. Some Sharran priests like him wear masks to conceal their identity – part of the whole secrecy thing that Shar likes.

## Personality

### Primary motive

He is… suicidal :)

What he tells people is that this expedition serves as his religious pilgrimage, which is true, but it’s also self-serving: Fugue has a self-destructive streak and thinks joining oblivion is the answer to all his problems.

### Primary fear

### A secret only they know
# Backstory

**Background:** Haunted One

**Languages:** Common, Orc, plus two more from Haunted One background (idk yet)

**Occupation:** Sharran priest working in the House of Grief (yes I stole it from *Baldur’s Gate 3*)

**Societal standing:** TBD

**Birthplace:** Baldur’s Gate, I guess

**Gender woes:** something about how his femininity and lack of genitals make him feel like he’s not a man at all. Including the fact that most people, especially his colleagues, do not see him that way. A man who’s not a man.

## Present

### 1 year before the expedition

Fugue has been staying for in Halia for a year with two other Sharran researchers who went on their own expeditions ahead of him. They’ve set up a business in the criminal underbelly of Luden’s Rest, relieving people of their grief.
