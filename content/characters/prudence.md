# Prudence Ward
## Physical Description

Prudence is tall for a human woman, standing ramrod straight at 6’4”. Big shoulders, long, pillar-thick legs. She has long, dark, straight hair framing her cool, brown face, and you find you can’t bring yourself to look away from her *terrible, galvanic-blue* eyes. A commanding presence, to be sure, with a barely-disciplined rage simmering beneath. Even so, she respects propriety and order, above all things.

- ragebait-able
	-  a kid could very well ragebait her just because she takes things too seriously
- can’t seem to relax even when off-duty
	- will refuse to partake but can be persuaded to do so
- keeps watch for anyone who might cause trouble

## Backstory

- [[Maxim]] invited her as a coworker/acquaintance thing — they met during one of his diviner stints. She likes to make a good impression, I think
- Prudence has arrested [[Kin]] once on account of causing trouble at a gala where [[Carillon]] was performing
